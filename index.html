			I am currently affiliated with the <a href="https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn//">Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence</a> (ISTBI) and the <a href="https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/">School of Data Science</a>, <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a>, serving as the Director of Professional Training Program.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/470"> Jianhua Huang</a>. I then held a postdoctoral research position for one year before joining Fudan. Prior to this, I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/"> Peking University</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			My research lies at the intersection of statistics and artificial intelligence, with a focus on nonparametric methods, statistical machine learning, and functional data analysis. A recent area of strong interest involves modeling noisy data with physical mechanisms governed by differential equations, particularly for its applications in Digital Twin Brain.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I am actively seeking motivated students to join my research group. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV.
